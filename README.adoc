== What is this?

Skein.jl is a lightweight database layer for knot theory data. It stores knots as Gauss codes, automatically computes invariants on insert, and lets you query by those invariants.

Named after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skein_relation[skein relation] — the algebraic rule that decomposes a knot crossing into simpler pieces, much like a query decomposes a database into matching records.

Works standalone, or as a persistence layer on top of https://github.com/hyperpolymath/KnotTheory.jl[KnotTheory.jl].

== Quick start

[source,julia]
----
using Skein

db = SkeinDB("knots.db")

# Store knots by Gauss code
store!(db, "trefoil", GaussCode([1, -2, 3, -1, 2, -3]),
       metadata = Dict("family" => "torus", "notation" => "3_1"))

store!(db, "figure-eight", GaussCode([1, -2, 3, -4, 2, -1, 4, -3]),
       metadata = Dict("family" => "twist", "notation" => "4_1"))

# Query by invariant
three_crossings = query(db, crossing_number = 3)

# Range queries
small_knots = query(db, crossing_number = 0:5)

# Metadata queries
torus_knots = query(db, meta = ("family" => "torus"))

# Statistics
stats = Skein.statistics(db)
# (total_knots = 2, min_crossings = 3, max_crossings = 4, ...)

close(db)
----

== With KnotTheory.jl

When both packages are loaded, additional methods become available:

[source,julia]
----
using KnotTheory, Skein

db = SkeinDB("research.db")

# Store KnotTheory types directly (coming soon)
# pd = PlanarDiagram(...)
# store!(db, "my-knot", pd)
----

== Features

**Storage**:: SQLite-backed, WAL mode for concurrent reads. Knots stored as serialised Gauss codes with invariants computed on insert.

**Querying**:: Filter by crossing number, writhe, Gauss hash, name pattern, or metadata key-value pairs. Supports exact values, ranges, and sets.

**Import/Export**:: Bulk import from CSV or `(name, GaussCode)` tuples. Export to CSV or JSON.

**Deduplication**:: Content-addressed hashing of Gauss codes detects duplicate diagrams stored under different names.

== Computed invariants

Currently computed on insert (standalone, without KnotTheory.jl):

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Invariant | Description

| `crossing_number`
| Number of distinct crossings in the diagram

| `writhe`
| Signed crossing sum (diagram-dependent)

| `gauss_hash`
| SHA-256 of the Gauss code for deduplication
|===

The KnotTheory.jl extension will add richer invariants as they become available.

== Installation
