= Skein.jl Roadmap
:toc:

== v0.1.0 (Complete)

* [x] Core types: `GaussCode`, `KnotRecord`
* [x] SQLite storage backend with WAL mode
* [x] Invariant computation: crossing number, writhe, Gauss hash
* [x] Keyword queries by invariant values
* [x] Import/export: CSV, JSON, bulk import
* [x] Deduplication via content-addressed hashing
* [x] 51 tests passing

== v0.2.0 (Complete)

* [x] KnotTheory.jl package extension (PlanarDiagram to GaussCode bridge)
* [x] Jones polynomial column with schema migration (v1 -> v2)
* [x] KnotInfo import (prime knots 0_1 through 7_1)
* [x] Composable query predicates with `&` (AND) and `|` (OR)
* [x] Knot equivalence checking (canonical form, cyclic rotation, relabelling)
* [x] Mirror image and amphichirality detection
* [x] Reidemeister I simplification
* [x] `find_equivalents` and `find_isotopic` database searches
* [x] Property-based tests (invariant consistency, store/fetch round-trip)
* [x] Benchmark suite
* [x] Full RSR template structure
* [x] Julia General registry compatibility (compat bounds for all deps)
* [x] 493 tests passing

== v0.3.0 (Planned)

* [ ] Julia General registry submission
* [ ] Reidemeister II simplification (removing two-crossing loops)
* [ ] Reidemeister III simplification (triangle moves)
* [ ] Full topological amphichirality detection
* [ ] Extended KnotInfo table (prime knots through 10+ crossings)
* [ ] Alexander polynomial (standalone computation)
* [ ] Bracket polynomial (standalone computation)
* [ ] KnotTheoryExt integration tests
* [ ] CSV import test coverage
* [ ] CI/CD workflows (CodeQL, Scorecard, mirror, hypatia-scan)

== v0.4.0 (Future)

* [ ] Link support (multi-component knots)
* [ ] Knot atlas web integration (fetch from KnotInfo online)
* [ ] Spatial graph database extension
* [ ] PackageCompiler.jl shared library for C FFI
* [ ] Idris2 ABI formal interface proofs
* [ ] Zig FFI C-compatible bindings
* [ ] Performance: connection pooling, prepared statement caching
* [ ] Knot diagram visualisation (via Makie.jl extension)

== Long-term

* [ ] Distributed knot database (multi-node SQLite replication)
* [ ] Knot machine learning features (embedding vectors for knot classification)
* [ ] Integration with computational algebra systems (GAP, Sage)
* [ ] WASM compilation for browser-based knot explorer
